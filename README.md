# MichaelHumiston.com
This repository contains the code for my personal website [https://michaelhumiston.com](https://michaelhumiston.com)
and all the tools to build and deploy it (except for the images).

## How It Works
It is a single-page web application written using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react). The code can be built into a ready to deploy format using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) tasks.

## Requirements
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) needs to be installed locally to download the dependencies and run the Gulp build tasks.

## Developing
Development can be done using the configured [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) by running `npm start` to start the dev server. Whenever a change is made, the page will automatically refresh itself.
